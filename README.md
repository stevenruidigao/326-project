# 326-project

# TODO

According to the end of Milestone 2, we need to:

> Include a README.md file in the root of the project repository detailing the **project structure**, **setup instructions**, and **documentation** necessary to _understand and navigate your application_.

This repository contains code for both milestone-01 and milestone 02 in src/. The code for milestone-01 is in src/docs/milestone-01 and the code for milestone-02 is in src/client.

To set up this project to run locally, run `npm install` in the project root.

Run `npm run milestone-01` or `npm run milestone-02` to start the server for milestone-01 and milestone-02, respectively.
