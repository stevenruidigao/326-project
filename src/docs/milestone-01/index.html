        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Our vision focuses on improving the learning experience of students
            across the world. Students possess a multitude of knowledge that can
            be exchanged, resulting in improved learning for everybody. Our web
            app aims to connect these varying pieces of knowledge. Specifically,
            we tailor to students who can help others with their classes in
            exchange for the same in return. Tutoring is often a one-way
            exchange of information in which only the tutee benefits. However,
            we want all parties involved to partake in learning and leave the
            session with knowledge that they deem useful and/or interesting. If
            you’re a student who needs help with CS 326 (just an example!), you
            can find a tutor who is willing to help but is looking to learn
            more about another area that you are familiar with. In that case,
            you’d both be a match and could tutor each other on the other’s
            desired subject. <em>There’s no need for monetary exchange; the only
            exchange necessary is that of the mind.</em>
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- With the id "overview," this section should provide a 150-200 word explanation of the web application your team aims to design and develop. Use an <h2> tag for the section title.

      <section id="application-parts">
        <h2>Application Parts</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Authentication is a primary component of our application. Since we
            want users (users are both tutors and tutees) to showcase what they
            can teach others and connect with them, they need a profile that
            contains that information such that other tutors can find them.
            Thus, a login is needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Profiles themselves are a critical component. For a user to be able
            to find someone who can teach them what they need to know, and to
            whom they can teach something in return, this information has to be
            available. Thus, profiles will contain a user’s “strengths” and
            “weaknesses” - or what they can teach others, and what they need to
            be taught/tutored on. To showcase the legitimacy of these users,
            there’ll be an XP system with ratings and comments that allow for
            others to provide feedback on their experience with said user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the aim is to connect with someone so that both can expand
            their horizons, there also needs to be a method to communicate.
            Thus, a chat system that allows for inter-user communication is key.
            In addition to this chat, we’ll have a way to make requests – this
            will likely be how a chat gets opened between users. Then, they can
            communicate and establish what they can both gain from the swap.
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Identified by the id “application-parts,” describe at least three critical components of your application in separate paragraphs under this section, totaling 200-300 words. Title this section with an <h2> tag and ensure each application part discussed represents a primary functionality of your web application. Here is an example of a one component of an application: -->
      </section>

      <section id="data-requirements">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            TutorSwap will need to handle authentication data, profile data,
            appointment data, and chat data to accomplish its goals. These four
            types of data will allow our application to function smoothly and
            properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, we need to store, manage, and securely use authentication
            data. We require the user to be logged in to interact with
            other users and make appointments, as well as to see the full
            profiles of other users. We may allow a logged-out user to view the
            number of tutors available in their area to convince them to sign up
            for an account, but we would also like to respect user privacy and
            require a login to prevent abuse through interactions. We will
            require the user to use an email address and password to log in and
            will use a session ID stored in the user’s browser to keep them
            logged in across pages. Users should not have access to other users’
            non-public data such as email, and should only be able to edit their
            own data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, one of the foundational data requirements for TutorSwap is
            each user’s profile data. This includes the basic profile
            information, such as the image for their profile picture, their
            name, and their unique username. We need to store tutoring-related
            information, such as courses/topics that they can tutor,
            topics/courses they want tutoring in, an XP number that represents
            their experience tutoring on this platform, rating data based on
            reviews from past tutees, and optionally a rough geographical
            location to more easily connect with other students in the same
            area. This information will allow students to easily see whether
            another student would be a good match for each other’s needs, as
            well as to see if they are generally good tutors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we need to store appointment data of past tutoring
            sessions, mainly so that we can store review data to be displayed on
            profiles and to help students gauge how good of a tutor another
            student may be. This would include storing a rating and comments for
            each review, the date of the tutoring session, whether the session
            was in-person or remote, and tags for the courses/topics covered in
            the tutoring session. Not all of this information will be public to
            everyone; we will only show the full date to the users involved in
            the appointment to preserve their privacy while allowing other users
            to gauge how recent this feedback is. This review data will allow
            students to hold other students accountable for their tutoring
            sessions, encouraging students to try their best when tutoring so
            that their good reviews will allow them to make more tutoring
            sessions in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, since we allow users to chat with each other to set up
            tutoring sessions, we need to record message data. This includes the
            users that each user is chatting with and the users that they’ve
            blocked. Additionally, we need to store chat logs, including the
            date and time of each message.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storing the authentication, profile, appointment, and chat data is
            essential to ensuring that our web application functions properly.
            By storing this data on the server and only making the necessary
            bits available to users (depending on what they are able to see), we
            will be able to provide the functionality to allow skill exchanges.

        <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Our platform’s goal is to connect students to other students who
            have previous or current experiences in each other’s classes and are
            able to help each other. Our objective is to allow for students to
            get help with any issues they are confused about or generally
            receive tutoring to help them understand concepts better. In
            addition, we are trying to address the issue of how expensive
            tutoring can be. Looking online, it is easy to find tutors offering
            their services from $50/hr all the way to $200/hr, which isn’t very
            affordable and accessible to most college students. By allowing
            students to pay for tutoring with more tutoring, we are increasing
            the accessibility of tutoring to all students regardless of their
            financial means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we are trying to address the issue of how difficult it can
            be to find and connect with others who have taken a specific class.
            Asking around the current class may not always be helpful, as many
            peers may also be confused or not understand the concepts well
            enough to teach them, and there is no easy way to find students who
            have taken the class in the past. We aim to solve this problem by
            offering students an easy and centralized way to look for help with
            a specific class or topic.

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Firstly, our experiences in some of the courses from our university
            education directly relate to our ability to efficiently program this
            application using best practices. CS 220 has taught us many
            programming methodologies and best practices, which helps us write
            better and more efficient JavaScript for this web application. Those
            of us who have taken CS 345 have gained experience with managing
            and designing databases, which helps us better organize and manage
            user data in this web application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, our experiences participating in many hackathons have
            given us lots of experience with developing full stack applications
            with an interactive and intuitive user interface. These experiences
            will help inform our decisions in crafting a beautiful user
            interface and a smooth user experience, as well as with managing
            user data in ways that are logical, organized, and secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, our project idea is inspired by many of our struggles
            getting help in some of our classes. Even though many CS classes
            offered tutoring through the CICS tutoring portal in conjunction
            with CICS 298A, many of the General Education courses taught under
            different departments had different ways of offering tutoring and
            support that were sometimes difficult to navigate. Our goal with
            this application is to solve those issues by centralizing these
            tutoring resources in one site.
